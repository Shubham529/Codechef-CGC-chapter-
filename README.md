Technologies Used In Our Project-:
1.) Node JS, Express JS, Paasport JS, MongoDB

2.) ADOBE XD 2019 (For initial prototyping), Corel Draw Graphics Suite 2020, Adobe Illustrator CC 2019
 to use but Google Docs takes the edge over reliability. One con of Google Docs is that it only works online though, but it is synced across the internet easily. So there is no risk of losing our content. That's why I prefer Google Docs over others.

3.) Adobe Illustrator CC 2019,Adobe Lightroom CC 2019, Adobe Photoshop Portable CS6, Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019, Canva Online Designer Website, Freepik Graphics Vector Collections, Icons8 Smart AI Upscalar,
Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 is currently available the best and stable version of Illustrator rather than the new 2020. Moreover, I have quite a lot of hands-on experience with this version. It does supports Scripts and Plug-ins that CS6 version lacks, and has Adobe Support that other software, like Inkscape, lacks.

Adobe Lightroom CC 2019, is the only professional color grading software available, helped to fully perform tasks like, overlaying, Blurring, Adding a certain amount of glow to Neon effects, that are prevailing in the Website design. Lightroom is better than other Adobe Software for this specific set of tasks.

Adobe Photoshop Portable CS6, Being Portable and Low Version, helped for doing little tasks and low-level designing, as it didn't require a good amount of processing and It also did a great part in exporting the required PNGs easily, which would have been a huge task if had used CC version.

Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019, is the best video editor app than its predecessors like Premiere and Premiere Rush. It allowed me to export in high-quality GIF frame images, to be bind together to make the GIFs for the site. Moreover, it provided a high-speed export rate and a better sequence-timeline ratio.

Canva Online Designer Website provided fast real-time edits and is a good source to rely on, whenever I hadn't had my PC. Canva is best for last-minute edits and Being Compatible on Android, gave me more power and workspace to complete my projects.

Freepik Graphics Vector Collections is a community of Graphics Vectors, provided by professional Graphics Designer for premium or free - attribution based. Freepik provided free Vectors for my Projects, that most of the Graphics websites lack. Freepik provided me with the raw materials to be designed and used in various aspects of the website.

Icons8 Smart AI Upscalar is the only Free-to-use Upscaler, that extend the quality of my images and dimensions.Being the only online Upscaler available, This was my only choice.
HTML5 for webpage structure. 2.CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 for web design and color patterns.
HTML5 is the latest version of html which is best for creating the structure of the website. CSS 3 is much better as it allows to create a different style file which make code neat. Bootstrap is a consistent framework that supports major of all browsers and CSS compatibility fixes. Lightweight and customizable.
HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, Brackets 1.14.2
HTML 5 - There are other versions of HTML in the market but I used this because it has semantic tags which helps a lot in SEO and it has some more features than the other versions. then CSS3 has a almost all designing functions with the latest animations and much more. That's why I used these version. Then talking about bootstrap there was bootstrap 5 also available in the market but that was in alpha release which it was not a stable option so I decided to use the previous version version 4. I used bootstrap in this amazing project because it is the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites. It has amazing set of components which can be modified easily and the most important things is you don't have to worry about responsivity of the site while using this. It is also the most like project on the git hub. Earlier there was support for gryphicons i.e., one can add icons in the site while using bootstrap only but in 4th version they remove this so I use fontawesome v5.7.0 to add amazing icons in the site. It is really good and one can customize the icons as per their needs. Now talking about the IDE i used Brackets v1.14.2 latest at this time. It is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor. It blend visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it without getting in the way of your creative process. I really enjoy writing code in Brackets. It supports live preview too with just one click.
